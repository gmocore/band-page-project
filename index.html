            About the band
        </h2>
        <p>At this point in ourt career, aside from not existing, we are making strides to reach our ideal fanbase. We don't play good musaic, or ay music at all, for that matter. A lot of music is terrible, so we aim to nest ourselves within that perfect little niche</p>
        <p>i am not feeling terribly creative at the moment. I am just typing out words because i didn;t feel like using a lorem generator, and these sentences will at least have a decvent amount of semantic structure</p>
